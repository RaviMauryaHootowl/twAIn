I came out of my treehouse to see what I could do, and
saw a large brown rat lying on the ground; then,
suddenly, as though in a dream, I heard a mighty crashing of
cannibals, and a huge noise of sharp knives.

It was the servant girl, and she came running up, and
carried the rat away with her.

I had scarcely time to run to my nearest window when I heard the
shriek of a horse's trot, and saw the great black figure of a man
running toward me.

I only saw him for a few moments, and then I saw that he had
just come from the woods. He came to me, carrying a big stick
and a heavy stick, and was about to run toward me when I saw how he
had come.

"Here's your reward, my boy," he said to me, "for doing your duty."

Then, as he passed the stick, he took from his pocket a small
towel, and then he ran toward me.
