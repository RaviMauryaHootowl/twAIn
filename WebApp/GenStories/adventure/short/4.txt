Far away i could see a small village,
with a very small church, and a small black cottager with a
lady in a red mantle.  I called the little house to which I was going
to give the letter, and told the landlord what I had seen.

The landlord gave me a hearty laugh, and said, “I am glad to hear
you are well satisfied.”

“And at the same time,” said I, “I expect you will be pleased to hear
that your carriage will be taken up in a few minutes, and that you will
not have to pay anything for your journey.”

“No,” replied the landlord, “you should have heard me, and that you would
have done better not to listen to me.”

“Then,” said I, “you will not have to pay the court, and I will
not tell you what.
