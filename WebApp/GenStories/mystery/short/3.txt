I saw towards the tree the figure of a little man
neat and trim in middle age—strengthened muscles, a
burden of purpose, a soldierly air, one which, though
rather eccentric in its character, is wholly appropriate. He
was a tall man—taller than the Eton or the
High Peak, and far taller than any other man I have ever seen.
He was well dressed, but his manner was that of a man of
middle age. His face was sunken, his lips curling, and
the color of a man who has had a long rest. His hair
was cut very short, and his features were of a rather austere
character, accentuating the features of the head and neck.

I could tell that he was a man of learning and learning. I
knew that he had studied Latin, and that he had been in
the habit of doing so, so I could easily deduce that he
had a mind of the highest order. I made him my cipher and
also my decoy.
