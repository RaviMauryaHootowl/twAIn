We sat inside the train, in a bleak little
substitute for the more cheerful village. With a sigh of relief I
looked out of the window. I had made a mistake. I had a
fool for a fault. And now I was able to do something about it.
I left the train at the station and took a bus to the town.
There was the suburb which looked out upon a huge expanse of
the sea. I was in the middle of it, and I was standing for a
thirsty walk. I turned, and looked up at the sky. It was an
empty space, and the clouds had disappeared. I felt a
chill of fear sweep over me. I had the feeling that I was in
for a real walk. I stopped, and looked at the sky. The sky was
empty. I looked up at the trees. They were all gone. I lay down
with a start. Then I noticed that the grass had withered away.
I turned, and looked up at the trees again. They were gone. I
strolled aimlessly for a while. I had no idea what to do. I
strolled aimlessly for a while. Then I came to a clearing.
I was on a walk in the garden. I was alone. I looked down
the path. There was nothing there. I stood there for a while,
not daring to move. Then I came to a clearing. It was empty.
I looked up at the trees. They were gone. I sat there for a
while. Then, with a terrible idea, I jumped down from the tree
with a cry of joy. I was at the end of the woods.

I stood there for a long time. I tried to breathe. I tried to
think. One thing was clear. I should get away. And I would
probably like to go out in the world. I had a bright idea. I
strolled aimlessly all the way to the outskirts of town. Then I
looked up, and there is the end of the woods, a sign of the
end of the world, and the end of all hope. I had no more interest in
the world.

The idea came to me again and again. Why not? Why not? Why not? What
was all this? What was this all about? I looked round me, and saw only
a bleak desolate place, with the trees gone, the woods
unfenced, and the woods full of the grave. I walked in that direction.

I had no idea that I was walking in the woods.
