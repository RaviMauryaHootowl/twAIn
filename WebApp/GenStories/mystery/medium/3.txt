We stood in front of the room, and, looking into his eyes, I saw the tear
from his eye.

“Well,, then, Mr. Holmes?”

“Well, then, Miss Hunter.”

He sprang from the chair and ran swiftly across the room.

“I suppose, Mr. Holmes, that you are not very pleased that for this
crime you have been tried without the use of a jury, Miss Hunter?
It is a very considerable blow to your case. But, Mr. Holmes,
I am very much better pleased that you have not been put through the
piercing.”

“Piercing!”

“Yes, sir; that is a very serious blow. I should have thought a
juror guilty of the same offence.”

“Have you any excuse, Mr. Holmes?”

“None whatever. I should be very glad to have a jurymen who were not so
jurally.”

“Jurors!”

“No; I assure you that there is no such thing as a juror.”

“Jurors!”

“No; but, Mr. Holmes, there are many who are so foolish as not to realize
the very grave nature of their task.”

“I see. I should like to add one more thing. Do you know, Miss Hunter,
that when I was in the company of Mr. Neville St. Clair, at our hotel,
I had the great fortune to see the apparition of a locket, which
I have retained for over two hundred years?”

“Yes, sir.”

“It is a very simple matter. A gentleman by the name of St. Clair,
in reference to his wife’s maiden name, has it got upon his finger-tips?”

“No, sir, I do not know his name. I never have.”

“I am sure, Miss Hunter, you do. And here is a letter which I have seen in your
possession. If you would be good enough to sign it, sir, I should be glad to
be able to give you my initials.”

“Certainly.”

“I am pleased to advise you that the signature is, sadly, incomplete.”

“I am afraid so.
