Hello World', et cetera, were
heard now. The county, and the sea, were now about to make the
lamentable noise of their horrid inaudible noises. The
great wall of the very heaven, and the blaze of the bright fire,
were all heard now. The wind, and the waves, were now
falling in heavy waves, and the waves were now appearing
more and more. The sea was now rising and sinking, and all
around were the sounds of roaring and pealing.

The air was now so foul and so foul that it was impossible
to breathe. The sea-shells were now being shaken and blown
and blown, and the waves were raging, and the waves were now
crashing with a loud crash.

"Now," cried Charles, "let's get to the bottom of this wretched
mystery! Let's get to the bottom! I must be on the spot,
for I must know the truth, and I must know that these horrible
machines are not allowed to go on! I must know that the dead are not
allowed to rise again! I shall never know, if not for the life of
myself! I must know that I am not permitted to live, and that I
must die! No more can I do! There is no more to be said, and I
must die! ——I die!"

"Yes, yes," said Charles; "let's get to the bottom of
this. ⁉’N.

“Here, let me be upon you, my boy,’ said Henry; "I
will go and fetch you a glass of wine.’

"Do so or not," said Charles, "you shall die!’

"No; I will not die.’

"Aye, agree to my conditions.’

"Do so, or I will destroy you!’

"Agreed! I will not do anything against the terms of
this contract.’

"Agreed!" said Charles.

"Do so," said Henry; "it is all to do with that dreadful
monster! Do so or not, and I shall leave you to die!’

"Agreed," said Charles; "and you shall die when you are
consentably disposed to do so."

"Agreed; but not till I have seen you before I will agree to
this contract.
