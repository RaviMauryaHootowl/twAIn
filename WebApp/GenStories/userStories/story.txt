I went towards the forest, and I soon

found a little house on the edge of a high hill. I ordered a table and a

pot of tea, and as I had no money, I took a bag of gold and

came back with a basket of provisions. The house was very small

and poor, but I was not sorry to take the chance of getting some

food for my journey. I placed the bag on the table, and

without further ado, I entered it. I found that my old friend, the

old gentleman, had died a long, slow, and melancholy death.



I was very sorry to see him go, but I was not sorry to see my old

friend, who had been the most helpful to me, again living,

for I wanted nothing more than to see him again.



I returned to my inn, carrying my wife and the bag of gold, and

took my journey towards the village of Moulins.



After a short time I arrived at the house of the gentleman, and

took care of the servants, who were to receive me with great

disappointment.



As I had resolved to take my wife and the house, as well as the

couriers, who were to carry my luggage, I set out by the

main road, and soon reached the village of Lille. It was

about eleven oâ€™clock in the evening, and I had been walking about

for three hours.



I found the inn, and found that I had found my travelling

companion, William, who was at home. He had been obliged, in

part, to give way the day before, to go to the siege of the

Lorraine, and that the next day

he would serve as a guide.



I was very excited at this discovery, and I was about to go

to the siege myself, when I was suddenly attacked by

a violent headache. I was almost knocked out with its pain,

but the pain soon abated, and I began to recover my senses.



I immediately called for a physician, and found that it was

the general opinion that I had contracted some kind of

meningitis, and that I might expect much worse from the

tumultuous journey I was about to undertake.



We therefore decided that William should conduct me to the

restoration of the injury, and that the attendant should remain at

the inn.
