What
should I do with him? It is a dull business, you know.
No, Mr. Holmes; I must remain where I am. I have no wish to
part from my friend. If he is dead, so be it. But if I
have life to keep, I shall do it with all my heart. And here
are your lodgings. I shall be all busy this afternoon, so I
may as well tell you all that I know.

"I met you last Thursday at the house of Dr. James Mortimer.
He is the father of the young man who has been your
companion. The young man has been in the habit of coming
up to the house, and asking if you were all right. I
suppose he did not always come in the evening, but this was
the fourth time he did so. He is a neat, unassuming,
pontified man, with a tuft of reddish hair at the dread hat.
