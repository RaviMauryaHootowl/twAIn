I was very scared. I was frightened. I was scared. I was afraid. And the terrible thing was, that I saw--I saw a thing. And I was afraid. And then I got out of the tree, and I saw it. And I could not tell what it was. But I must tell you, that it was something of a sort of a thing, that had caught a little, and had come out of the trees, and was circling about the tree. And I could not tell the thing from what it was. But I knew it was a thing, and I knew I could not see it.

But I did see it; and then I knew I could not see it; and so I went up to the tree, and I saw it again. And I went to the tree, and I saw the same thing; and I knew that it was the same thing; but, I could not tell what it was.

But I determined to go out, and see if I could see--I would go and see if I could see it, and I knew that I did see it; and I went out, and I saw it again.
