I heard a voice from behind the door
of the cupboard, and it seemed animatedly to speak to me in a
new tongue, and to speak to me in a language of my own. “You are
in the presence of the devil,” he said, “and are therefore to be
killed.’ I felt his touch upon my arm, and he sprang to
the floor, and bade me farewell, for the time being.

“Come, come,” said I, “to witness the desolation of a
little house.’ Then I rid myself of the cupboard, and
drew up into my chair.

“Truly it is a horrible place,” I said to myself. “It is
like nothing that has ever been seen.’ I looked out of the window
and saw only a great mass of grey and dead things.

“The old house burned,” he answered, “what was the old
house burned for?’ I could not answer him, for I had not
heard of the great fire that burned the house.
