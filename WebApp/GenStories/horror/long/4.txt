I saw a skeleton hanging from the gallows, and it was
wholly naked."

"Had you anything to drink before you were hanged?"

"No; and I had a glass of wine, which I drank."

"How did you pass the night?"

"I slept on a stone wall by the river side."

"Why," cried the Doctor, "you can't be one of the criminals!"

"Oh, no!" said the Doctor, and he dropped his glass of wine.

"I know it, Doctor; I know it."

"You're a fool," said the Doctor, "and that's why you're hanged.
Do you need a gallows?"

"No; perhaps I'll be hanged myself."

"Go to your cell, and dress yourself, and you'll be hanged."

"I'm a convict," said the Doctor, "and can't go to the gallows. I ought
to be hanged."

"You'll be hanged," said the Doctor, "and I'll be hanged."

The Doctor paused, and then raised his eyes to heaven.

"Do you understand then," said he, "that you're an outlaw, and
you can't go to the gallows? Well, then, go to the gallows. I'll
be hanged and hanged myself if I don't go."

The Doctor was silent for a moment, and then he said--

"I'll go."

"But it'll be a horrible place," said the Doctor.

"No, no; I'll have a view of it."

The Doctor went and walked towards the gallows, and then
he turned and looked round him.

"What a ghastly place it is; and it will be impossible to
pass it in death."

"It will be impossible, Doctor," said the Doctor.

"It is," said the Doctor, and he walked slowly towards the
gallows.

"My dear friend," said the Doctor, "this is a ghastly place,
and I'll find a ghastly place wherever I go. I'm a
criminal, and I'll be hanged."

"There's no stone wall on the end of the river," said the
Doctor.

"And I'll be hanged where it is."

"That will be a ghastly place," said the Doctor; "it's a
ghastly place, and the devil knows what to do with him. I'll
have him out of it."

"I know it," said the Doctor; "but I'll have him out of it
by any means."

"I know it, Doctor," said the Doctor, and he walked slowly towards
the gallows.

"Come along, Doctor," said the Doctor. "Do not expect an easy
job. I'll have him out at once."

"I am quite ready, Doctor," said the Doctor.

"Go," said the Doctor, "and I'll have him out at once."

"You'll be hanged," said the Doctor, "and I'll be hanged, and I
will be hanged, and I'll be hanged. I'll be hanged, and I
will be hanged."

"I will. No, no," said the Doctor, "I'll be hanged. I'll
be hanged, if I can. You're a bad fellow, Doctor, and
I can't do anything but hang you."

"What have I done wrong?" said the Doctor; "what are
you doing?"

"I'm a criminal, and I can't go to the gallows. Why, now,
I can go to the gallows, and I'll be hanged."

"Why, then, go still," said the Doctor; "go, and I'll
be hanged."

"No, no," said the Doctor. "I'll go to the gallows myself, and
then I'll be hanged myself. It's a ghastly place, and I
can't go to the gallows.
