Suddenly a voice shouted, "Hark! we are lost!" and the
glimpse of the beam was terminated by the thunder of the lid, and the
rattle of the wheels, as they rolled into the sea, and the sweep of the
floating lid.

"Hark! the lantern," cried the voice, "the lantern's been
pushed over by the lid, and now we shall perish in
the sea. Oh, you wretched creatures! are you not
free yet! The lantern is not yet out, and we must perish
there! You will perish in the sea! Ah, be not afraid! I will
save you--I will never perish! I will never perish! I will
never perish!"

The voice ceased, but the cry of the voice became perceptible to
the seamen, and they hastened to the buoy, that some day might
allow them to find a place where the lantern might be securely
covered.

"Hark! the lantern is now over the helm," shouted the voice, "the helm is
closed, and now we have no power to move. We must perish! Let us
set a seal upon the lantern; and if you will obey, we will set
an oar upon the helm."

The voice died, and the gipsies swept into the water, and,
turning, they brought the lantern over the helm, in a moment they were
in a calm, and compass pointed to the north.

"Hark ye," cried the voice, "the lantern is now over the helm."

"Hark ye, the oar's about to touch the helm, and we shall perish
in the sea."

"This will be our fate," said the voice, "it is certain; we shall
never be able to escape. We must perish in the sea; we must
die! The oar's touch the helm, and we will perish.
