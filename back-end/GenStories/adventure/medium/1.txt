I found myself on a raft at the mouth of the
lowland rivers. It was almost dark.

"This is the raft," said John. "I'm on it."

"Here come the dogs!" said the old man. "There ain't no need to
wig them, Major Johnson. We're in the jungle."

The dogs came galloping up the river, and John took his place.

They had been hunting for the raft of the Captain, but a sudden
hurry of footsteps had told them that it was too dark to see the
boat, and they had hurried to the other side. John had followed
them, but the old man had vanished.

"We're lost!" he said. "We can't get away from here!"

The old man was gone; the dogs ran after him.

A moment later they were upon a huge herd of jungle cats,
who had come down from the jungle to see if they were on the
boat. John saw the one that had run after him first, and
sighed as he saw the two others follow close behind.

"John!" cried the old man. "We've been lost! I know it. We're
lost!"

John was too concerned to hear the noise of the dogs, but
he could hear the growl of the herd.

"They're hunting us!" he shouted. "They're dogs of the
forest!"

"No, Major Johnson, you'll never find it. They're in the jungle
there," said the farmer. "They won't find us till after dark."

"There ain't no doubt about that," said John. "I know where they
are, but they won't be alone."

"I'll try my best to help," said the farmer, who had just given John
his first loaf of bread.

John had heard the barking of the dogs, and he hurried towards
them. He was not really afraid of the beasts, but he was afraid
of the jungle cats. He was also beginning to think of his future.

The first thing he saw was a small cottage on the river bank.

"John! It ain't you," said he to the woman. "It's me."

John found the cottage, and he sat down to welcome his new friend.

"Here, my dear, is where I want you, and where you'll need me most," said
the farmer. "You'll find it. You'll find it. I've been looking
for it.
