There was a big mountain called
the Roland, and the little town was called Porthos, which was where I
was. Such a place as that, I thought, to see all the
people of Porthos, and not to take a hundred pistoles or a
dollars. This was not the way I had ever been; I had never been
proud of it, and I hardly ever will.

I was very satisfied with this little visit, for I had not the
sickness of a man who had seen the world, and whose idea of
the world had been that it should be so. I had never suffered from
food or drink, and I had never had the stomach to think of it. I was
now free, and I was in a pleasant position. The world was to
attend to, and I was to receive my reward.

D’Artagnan had not gone far when he came to the Rue du Colombier
d’Artagnan, and M. de Treville’s magister had already succeeded in
getting into a cab, but this time he was not so fortunate. He
was obliged to stop.
