I found myself on a raft, in the
center of the island, where I could see nothing but the sea. I
could hear the dogs barking in the distance, but I could not see
them. I could see the sun rise in the horizon, and the moon
set behind me.

I had been in a state of reverie, and I could not get myself out
of it. I was resigned to myself, and I began to think of all my
things. The land was pleasant and fresh, and I made no more
mishaps in my mind.

I soon recovered myself, and I began to think of my escape. I had
discovered the garden, and I went to the house to look for it. I did
not find it; however, this time I succeeded in finding the
door of the cellar. I took a key and opened the door, and I
found a large chamber, protected by a large door opening into a
large garden, and a door of some kind fastened upon it. I examined
it, and found it was at once occupied by the person who had
saved me the day before, and was counting out my money.
