We looked at the tree as we went, and
there was the same curious, oval-shaped mark in the
ground where it had been cut. The mark was of oak, but it was
small and fastened firmly in the middle. I had not seen
it before, but now I saw that it was a mark upon the trunk of
the shrub which had been cut down as the village rose out of the
gloom.

"Well?"

"Well, it's a sign--a--a tree!"

"A--a tree?"

"Yes, a great-aunt of ours."

"What, in the name of the devil, is it?"

"Well, it's a big-eared black-billed curlew, which we saw in the
out-house this morning. It's a very big bird, and they're
not very fond of it. It's a glorious, wonderful bird, I
expect you to see it on the ground upon the other side of
the lane. It would be a pity to miss it. You see it, and
you hear it, and you both run together and you run very fast. It
is the most delicious thing you have ever heard. Come on, and
get out and have a look at it."

I saw the black-billed curlew which I had thought was the
same I had seen the Indian curling-needle upon the tree. I
felt a thrill of satisfaction, and then a thrill of terror, as I
realized that I was indeed not alone in my experience. The
giraffe was indeed upon the other side of the lane, and I was
left with the impression that I had crossed the line.

"We have our work to do, Watson. We have to find a
way home. It is not so easy. We are alone in the world
and we have the power of making a difference. Our friends are
all the same. We have the same enemies. You have the same
allies. We are making our own friends, and the world is
making ours. I wish you could be a part of it. I wish
you could be in it. You, Watson, I want you to be a
part of it. We have no business to lose. We are people of
heart. It is not enough for us to be on your side. We have to
be on yours. If you are on the right, I want you to
be on the left, too.
