We sat inside the train, my friend with long,
serious face, and I with my broad, playful one. I
had a small compartment for my horse and a small walk-way in front
of me, but the floor was all about me and the horses. It was
a little after nine that I felt that he was coming nearer.

"As I always do, I begin by doing my best to impress upon
him that I am in the same boat as he and that he is not a
fool. I am trying to offer him as much as I can within my own
rank and position, but I cannot do it if I am alone. I
shall try and do it when we meet again, but in a very
little time the idea of a romantic journey will be so
inherent in our plans that we shall both be out of commission.
I shall be the same, and I shall be a fool for it. I shall
be happy to go to any part of the world, but I shall not
get married until I am so far behind him as to be a burden to
him. I shall be on the road to the West Indies, but he shall
be in England all the time. The better to take his sweet time,
I shall be, the better to come back to you, and as to this
division of our duties, I shall do all that I can, but I
shall not be able to do all that I want to do. I think we shall
be in England by this time, and I shall have the pleasure of
examining your wishes. Now, my dear fellow,
-you may start as usual again, or you may remain in the
business of the future. You may go to any part of
the world or to any part of England, but you must not
stay longer than necessary. You can come to me at any
moment without any obligation, but you must keep me conscious
that you have a future. You must wish me to be your
companion, your wife, your mother. You must not wish me to be your
little friend. You must watch over me, and do all that you can to
keep me in your sight. If you wish to know that I am doing
this, know that I am doing it. If you wish to see it, know
that I am seeing you."

He uttered a piercing whistle and a very distinct
cry, which caused me to jump from my chair and begin to run fast
forward. Sherlock Holmes was standing aside with his
glassy eyes.

At the suggestion of my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, I
wrote a short story of the same title, entitled
The Study in Scarlet, in which I described the adventures of a
bride whose life has been turned upside-down by a mysterious
correlation which has been brought about by a marriage which has
finally, as you know, been consummated. It is interesting to note
that the original title of the story was the same as that of the
invented genus of the animal family, the ï¿½rio. I fancied that
I was not alone in my delight at the result which had been wrought by
my imaginative device. It was not long before I found that I was
right. After I wrote the story the next day I spoke of it to
a friend, and he, with his wife, a pretty young woman, had given it
to me for my signature. I regret that I do not know how I
received it, but I think that it is safe to say that it was
exceptionally warm and inviting.

"It was early after breakfast when I received the first
letter in which I was reminded that I was married. It was from
Harry Rayburn, and I replied at once with a smile on my face
and an enthusiastic reply.

"It has been a singular day, and I cannot forget the
pleasantness of telling you. The fact that you have asked me
for my signature and the title of a new story all signal
fascicles at me, and I am delighted to be able to say that I
dare not.
