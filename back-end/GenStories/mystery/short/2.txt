We sat in the train, and, for some reason, the train began to go on. I dreamed a dream that a man was sitting down at the
table, and that I saw a little man with a cigar. I don’t think I
should have noticed it at the time, but it was there and then and
then again as I turned round and looked at the clock that I saw a man. I
was so frightened that I must have run up the steps and felt
the man, for I didn’t see him after I ran up the stairs. I
was in the train in the yard and the yard sign was on the wall. I
was afraid that there were robbers in the yard and I rushed out to the
station and there was a big man there with a revolver. I asked if he
was a police man, and he said that he was. I took the revolver and ran at
him. When I got to the station I had the policeman to thank for
the coincidence of the day, and for running to me. I looked round for
my companion, but couldn’t find him.
