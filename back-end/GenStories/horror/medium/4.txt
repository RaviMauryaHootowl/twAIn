He was hung right on by the cross, and I had never seen anything like
that. And I remember when I was about to leave, thinking it was a very
horrible thing. For a while, I did not know whether I should live or
die; but then I remembered the picture of the cross; and I remembered
that I should meet him again in the grave. And I remembered the cross;
and I knew, that I shall meet him again in the grave. And I began to
think that I should meet him again in the grave; and it was a terrible
thought that came to me. Then I remembered the picture of the cross; for I
had lived many years without a picture of a cross, that did not
sit in the grave. And I remembered the picture of the cross; and I
believed that I should meet him again in the grave. And I went
to the grave; and I saw a very horrible thing in the grave. And I saw a
woman; and I perceived that she was the dead; for she had no
hair; and she had two hands that did touch the earth. And I saw
her, and she was very pale and wretched, and had no touch on her feet;
and she did have two hands that did touch the earth. And I saw
that her life was cut off, and that she was hung right on the
cross. And I saw a woman in the grave; and I saw what did
hurt her. And I saw a great rock, and a great pile of rock; and
there was a great heap of rock near the wall of the grave. And I went
away from the mound; but the woman did lie there, and did have
a great wound on the side of her face, where the rock had hit
her. And I saw a strange thing in the mound; and I saw that
there was no man there; but only a great rock, and a great pile of
rock in the mound, and in the rock pile, there was a great heap of
rock; and in the rock pile did lie the woman; and she was very
susceptible, and did live. And she did have before her a great
crutch, that did have a great wound on her hand, where the rock
had touched.
