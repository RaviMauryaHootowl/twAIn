I saw a woman running in white dress, and after she drew near a man in a white cloak. I shuddered, and didn't know how to react. I didn't know what to do. 
I ran away, and hid in a cave. She followed me, and I followed her. The
woman stopped, and there was a great battle. She was silent, but
she saw that I was fighting, and then she seemed to reach
out for a robe. I tried to help her, but she was too weak. Then
I ran forward, and I caught hold of her arm, and carried her
up the cave, and then I followed her. She seemed very frightened,
but we were in the cave, when I saw a great cloud of smoke
approach us, and then the earth shook a little. The rain fell
slowly. Then I saw that the earth was shaken by the thunder, but
we didn't see anything. Then we heard the thunder roar again, and we
saw the host of the dead, who ran at us from the great end of the
sky. I ran at them, and they were like hundreds of cenobites. The
sky was lit up, but we could not see anything. Then the earth shook
again, and we saw the dead crawling, and the earth shook again,
and I saw the cloud of a white mist. The dead were ruddy,
and the sea of coagulated blood was beginning. Then the water
seemed to shake, and the dead rose again, and the dead were
more numerous than they had been. They were all clothed in
white clothing. Then the dead rose again, and the dead were
more numerous than they had been. Then the dead came into the
torrents, and the world shook. The dead were ruddy, and the
sea of coagulated blood was beginning. Then the dead came into the
torrents, and the world shook. The dead were ruddy, and the
sea of coagulated blood was beginning. Then the dead were ruddy, and
the sea of coagulated blood was beginning. Then the dead came into the torrents, and the world shook.
