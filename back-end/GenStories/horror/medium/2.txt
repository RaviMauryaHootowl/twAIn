A doll was sitting on a rocking chair at the end of the room.
The sound of the door opening attracted the attention of the girls,
who came to see if they could get in, and who after a moment
contempered:--

"I'm afraid I could not get in, my dear, the door is locked."

The girls were so distressed by this circumstance they
fell back in their chair.

The doorkeeper was a very handsome man, and, as his
countenance did not betray the slightest emotion of
repulsion, he was very glad to be able to reply to their
ambition.

"Ah, my dear, I don't know what to do, but I'll try and
be quiet, I'm not afraid of anything, you know, my dear."

"I will try to be quiet," said the girl, who, in a tone of
sadness, was very anxious to have the doorkeeper
come in.

"I'll try to be careful," said the man, and he stepped
into the room.

"Don't worry yourself about anything, I'm sure we can't
be in any danger by the sound of the door."

"Try to be careful," said the girl, "I can't see anything
at all."

"Try to be careful, then, try to be careful."

"Try to be careful," said the man; "I don't know any
irregularities in the house. Try to be careful and I shall
be able to tell you something about them."

"I'll try to be careful," said the man; "but I'll be
wounded if I try to be careful."

"Try to be careful, then," said the girl, "I'll try
to be careful. I will try to be careful."

The man turned and said good-night.

The girl, who had experienced so much in the past hour, was
much pleased with the success of her resolution, and she departed
with the man.

The doorkeeper was one of those men who have a great fancy of
finding out what is entered upon the door, and he was determined
to find out whether or not the door was locked.
