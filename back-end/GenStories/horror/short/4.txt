I saw a doll sitting on a chair and
she was speaking to me, I looked up and saw that the door was
open and I went down to the doll and peered in to see what she
was saying. She seemed very angry, and I thought she was trying to
catch me out. She was talking about her father in the
present tense, and I picked up a few words of her father
and shouting, but her father was silent, and then she
brought out the picture, and looked at me, and said that it
was her father, and a hideous image of her father
appeared. She told me that it was the portrait that had
skewed her father, she had been looking at it for
several years, and that it had been taken in the dead of night
in a cottage in the woods, and it had been hanging over
the door, so that she could not see it. She was so sad
that I had to hold her close. She would not let go of the
picture, and would not even let me approach it, so that
I had to put my hand on her shoulder.
