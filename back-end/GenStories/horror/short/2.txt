I saw the woman coming into the room with the
descriptions of her wound. She was pale and pale and pale.

I knew then that she was dying. I could not breathe. I could not
move. I tried to speak to her, but could not. She was dying
from her wounds.

I lay there for some time in a state of suspended
fear. How could I get out of this? I could not move;
so I lay there with a voice trembling from fear.

Suddenly, I looked at the woman. She seemed to be dying.

I was lying there for a time in a state of suspended
fear. How could I get out of this? I was not dead, but I
could not move. I could not breathe. I tried to speak to her, but
could not. She was dying from her wounds.

She appeared to be dying. Her wounds were in her throat. She was
tearing, but not dying. I could not see her. She was dying.

Then, all at once, I heard a noise behind my bedroom window.
