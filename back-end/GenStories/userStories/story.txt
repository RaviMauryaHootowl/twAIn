I was sitting by the beach, and the first of the night I had

betrayed myself. I had gone over to the house of a man named Dash. I had

dreamt of him, and then I had guessed him. I had told him I had seen

something beautiful and splendid, and I was going to tell him to come

and see me. I went to Dash's house and told him I was going to tell him

that I knew him. Dash was very angry. I told him I was going to tell him

the truth and tell him Dash was not the man I had dreamed of. Dash was

just as angry, and said Dash could not think of a better bet. He

called Dash's mother and told her Dash had gone to a far country and

had returned and told her he was a great lover of horses. Dash

said he was going to tell Dash his story. Dash told him Dash had

never seen a horse before and that Dash had seen him riding one once,

and then Dash had been very jealous of Dash's horses. Dash asked Dash

what kind of horse he should buy for Dashâ€™s horses. Dash told him

he had seen a great many different kinds, and that Dash could not

tell which was which. Dash said there was one that Dash could own,

and that he would give Dash the chance to choose. Dash said he would

trust Dash to make a good horse, and he would give Dash the liberty of

choosing. Dash said Dash would give him the choice of one of a

dozen horses, and that Dash would give Dash the chance to choose the

one that best suited him, and that if Dash did not like the one

that was best suited to him, he could always get another horse

from another horse-monger. Dash said Dash would give him the opportunity

of choosing again. Dash said he would give him the choice of the horse

that was best suited to his fancy, and that he would not be

allowed to choose if he did not like the first horse. Dash then

said he would give him the choice of a second horse, and that Dash

would be allowed to choose that horse, but that the owner of the

first horse was to sell it to Dash for a fixed price. Dash said he

would sell Dash the horse for one hundred dollars, and that he would not

be allowed to choose the horse which was best suited to his fancy.
